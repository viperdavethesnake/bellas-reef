"""Black-box tests for scripts/install-hub.sh.

The script is driven as a subprocess against a fixture root with stub
executables on PATH. That is deliberate: mocking bash functions from pytest
would test a script nobody runs, and the ordering rules here (phase order,
what stops the run, what only warns) are exactly the properties a stubbed-out
version would stop checking.
